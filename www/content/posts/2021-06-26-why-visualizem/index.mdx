I’ve been always interested in visualizing what I know and visually learn new things. I believe it’s the best way to spread academic knowledge to people. For me, the best lessons in the world is a combination of good content and good visual.

I’ve been amazed when discovering how people are using Instagram Carousel to share knowledge and content. Valuable content, great visual, and in a bite-size. So I started to use Instagram to share my design tips. My goal was very ambitious: Getting 5K followers in 3 months. But of course, I was failed.

But when I look back  [all of my posts on Instgram](https://trongnguyen.co/design-tips), I’m proud of myself. I didn’t reach the goal, but I got good side effects. My design colleagues started to talk about my design tips, they call me an influencer. They all loved them and felt inspired. They started to ask me “Why why why you do it!”. My boss also started to pay attention to me, he just realized that he has an awesome designer on the team(?)

I stopped posting it because it took me lots of time and effort. But good content out there is still growing. I always learn new things every time I open Instagram.

There are many good posts created every day. But I found Instagram is only good with recent posts. They deprioritize old posts, even they are amazing. It’s impossible to find them. So I decided to create a space to save good content and spread them to you.

I appreciate the time and effort that every content creator invests to produce those posts. So every post should have a link to their original post.

Enjoy the best visual content on the internet. Great visual. Valuable content. Bite-size. It's [Visualizem](https://www.visualizem.cc)

Sincerely,
